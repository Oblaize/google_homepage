Using HTML and CSS re-create the Google Homepage, or any other popular website's interface

Try These Before Starting

These skills will be helpful for you when you start building. Either try them yourself or at least make sure you know how to do it:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)

Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage

Inside your project folder, create your index.html file

Tips:
DONT BE A PERFECTIONIST! You're just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function
like it and it doesn't have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel.
Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.
If you're frustrated with trying to get buttons or inputs to style the way you want
(for instance, they seem to just not respond to any styles), look into the css property
Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), 
then get them placed horizontally. You can either download the Google logo or link directly
to its URL on the web in your <img> tag.
Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it. Check out how to build a horizontal CSS navbar if you're lost.
Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.
In general, do as much on your own as you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page's source code) to help you along.
